    <p>In computer-based text processing and digital typesetting, 
        a non-breaking space or no-break space (NBSP) is a variant of the 
        space character that prevents an automatic line break (line Wrap)
        at its position. In certain formats (such as HTML), it also pre-
        vents the "collapsing" multiple consecutive whitespace charac-
        ters into a single space. The non-breaking space is also known as
        a hard space or fixed space. In HTML, a non-breaking space is cre-
        ated by replacing the space with &amp;npsp;. This is a non-breaking
        space: "" </p>
